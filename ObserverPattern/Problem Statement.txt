**Problem: Real-time Stock Price Monitoring**

 

Imagine you are developing a financial trading application that displays real-time stock prices to users. 
You need to ensure that when the price of a particular stock changes, all the relevant parts of the application 
(such as user interface components, analytics modules, and trading algorithms) are notified and can react to the 
change accordingly.

**Solution using the Observer Design Pattern:**

In this scenario, you can use the Observer Design Pattern to decouple the subject (the stock)
 from its observers (the components interested in its price changes). Here's how you can implement it:
1. **Subject (Stock):** Create a `Stock` class that represents a stock and maintains its current price. 
    This class will have methods to register, remove, and notify observers.
2. **Observer (Components):** Create observer classes (e.g., `PriceDisplay`, `AnalyticsModule`, `TradingAlgorithm`)
    that need to react to changes in the stock price. These observer classes should implement a 
    common interface (or inherit from a base class) that defines an `update()` method.
3. **Register Observers:** When an observer (e.g., `PriceDisplay` or `TradingAlgorithm`) wants to 
    monitor a particular stock, it registers itself with that stock object using the `registerObserver()` method.
4. **Notify Observers:** Whenever the stock price changes (e.g., due to market fluctuations), the `Stock` 
    class calls the `update()` method on each registered observer. Each observer can then take appropriate actions
    based on the new stock price.

By using the Observer Design Pattern in this scenario, you achieve the following benefits:

- Loose coupling: The `Stock` class is decoupled from its observers. It doesn't need to know the specific types of observers or their implementations, making the code more maintainable and extensible.
- Scalability: You can easily add or remove observers without modifying the `Stock` class, allowing you to scale your application with minimal changes.
- Real-time updates: Observers receive updates as soon as the stock price changes, ensuring real-time data for different parts of your application.

Overall, the Observer Design Pattern is a suitable solution for handling real-time event-driven scenarios like stock price monitoring where multiple components need to react to changes in a subject's state.
